# Test a Perceptual Phenomenon

## Overview
[Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect) is a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology. When the name of a color (e.g., "blue", "green", or "red") is printed in a color which is not denoted by the name (i.e., the word "red" printed in blue ink instead of red ink), are Incongruent words, where as the words with the same color as the name are Congruent words.

## Analysis
Create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the time consumed to read both Congruent and Incongruent words.
